    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The first semester of the club's existence started out with a bang! Our numbers grew rapidly, and everyone was
        eager to get started. As expected, there was a massive amount of interest in the club even before we began to
        promote ourselves. "I'm surprised there wasn't already a Web Development Club," was a common expression when we
        told others about the club. People of all skill levels joined and brought a wide range of skills to the
        table.<br></p>

                The first meeting was held September 2nd, 2015 in Coover Hall. The weather was nice, so we moved out to
                the courtyard to celebrate the club's founding with some soda and cookies. There were nine members in
                attendance, and we all had high hopes of doing great things with the club.

                The club made its first public appearance at the Fall 2015 ClubFest. We had sixty-eight people sign up
                for the mailing list. Membership more than doubled. In addition, we networked with other clubs and found
                out there was a huge interest in web development services around campus and around town. We would soon
                have our hands full!

                On September 19, 2015 we made excellent progress on the club website at HackISU, Iowa State's annual
                hackathon. Sleep was lost, caffeine was consumed, and Nicolas Cage image placeholders were used in
                abundance.
