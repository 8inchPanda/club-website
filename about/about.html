        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The first semester of the club's existence started out with a bang! Our numbers grew rapidly, and everyone
            was eager to get started. As expected, there was a massive amount of interest in the club even before we
            began to promote ourselves. "I'm surprised there wasn't already a Web Development Club," was a common
            expression when we told others about the club. People of all skill levels joined and brought a wide range of
            skills to the table.<br></p>

                    The first meeting was held September 2nd, 2015 in Coover Hall. The weather was nice, so we moved out
                    to
                    the courtyard to celebrate the club's founding with some soda and cookies. There were nine members
                    in
                    attendance, and we all had high hopes of doing great things with the club.

                    The club made its first public appearance at the Fall 2015 ClubFest. We had sixty-eight people sign
                    up
                    for the mailing list. Membership more than doubled. In addition, we networked with other clubs and
                    found
                    out there was a huge interest in web development services around campus and around town. We would
                    soon
                    have our hands full!

                    On September 19, 2015 we made excellent progress on the club website at HackISU, Iowa State's annual
                    hackathon. Sleep was lost, caffeine was consumed, and Nicolas Cage image placeholders were used in
                    abundance.
